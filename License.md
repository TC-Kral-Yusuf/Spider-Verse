> **Why is this project Closed Source?** <br> <br>
I understand that many people value Open Source projects and the transparency they provide. While Open Source, in theory, allows anyone to review the code and verify its safety, in practice very few people have the time, skills, or motivation to thoroughly audit a complex codebase. Most users simply download and run whatever build is easiest to access, without ever checking the source code themselves. This creates an opportunity for malicious actors to take publicly available code, insert hidden malware, and redistribute it as if it were a trusted release. Unfortunately, this is not just a theoretical concern — there have been many real-world cases where trusted mods and tools were compromised. As the sole developer of this project, I have invested significant time, effort, and creativity into its development. Making the source code fully public would not only expose the community to these kinds of security risks, but it would also make it easy for others to copy, rebrand, or misuse the work without giving anything back. By keeping the code private and using hash validation, I can ensure that every release is authentic, safe, and stable — protecting both the project and the players who rely on it. Its not something against you, its something **FOR** you.
